# Load flow

PowSyBl provides an implementation to run dynamic simulations with [DynaFlow](https://dynawo.github.io/about/dynaflow). DynaFlow is a new steady-state simulation tool that aims at calculating the steady-state point by using a simplified time-domain simulation, guaranteeing the correctness of the solution found. You can find more information about it [here](https://dynawo.github.io/about/dynaflow).

## Installation

You may download DynaFlow release packages from [here](https://github.com/dynawo/dynaflow-launcher/releases).

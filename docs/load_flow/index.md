PowSyBl provides an implementation to run [load flow](inv:powsyblcore:*:*#simulation/loadflow/index) with [DynaFlow](https://dynawo.github.io/about/dynaflow).
DynaFlow is a advanced steady-state simulation tool that aims at calculating the steady-state point by using a simplified time-domain simulation, guaranteeing the correctness of the solution found.
You can find more information about it [here](https://dynawo.github.io/about/dynaflow).

## Installation

You may download DynaFlow release packages from [here](https://github.com/dynawo/dynaflow-launcher/releases).

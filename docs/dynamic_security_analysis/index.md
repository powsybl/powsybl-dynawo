PowSyBl provides an implementation of the [DynamicSecurityAnalysis API from powsybl-core](inv:powsyblcore:*:*#simulation/dynamic_security/index) with [Dynaωo-algorithms](https://dynawo.github.io/about/dynalgo), a wrapper around [Dynaωo](https://dynawo.github.io) providing utility algorithms to calculate complex key values of a power system.

## Installation

Read this [documentation page](https://dynawo.github.io/install/dynalgo) to learn how to install and configure Dynaωo-algorithms.

## Going further

You may find an extensive documentation of the Dynawo project [here](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo/releases/latest/download/DynawoDocumentation.pdf).  
The dynamic security analysis use the same dynamic models supplier as the dynamic simulation implementation, documentation can be found [here](../dynamic_simulation/dynamic-models-dsl.md).
